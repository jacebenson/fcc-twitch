# Twitch

This frontend project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

The stories from this project are listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api).

Below I've listed them incase that changes;

1. User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
1. User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
1. User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
